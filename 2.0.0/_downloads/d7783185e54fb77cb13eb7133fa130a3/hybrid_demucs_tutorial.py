"""
Music Source Separation with Hybrid Demucs
==========================================

**Author**: `Sean Kim <https://github.com/skim0514>`__

This tutorial shows how to use the Hybrid Demucs model in order to
perform music separation

"""

######################################################################
# 1. Overview
# -----------
#
# Performing music separation is composed of the following steps
#
# 1. Build the Hybrid Demucs pipeline.
# 2. Format the waveform into chunks of expected sizes and loop through
#    chunks (with overlap) and feed into pipeline.
# 3. Collect output chunks and combine according to the way they have been
#    overlapped.
#
# The Hybrid Demucs [`Défossez, 2021 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03600>`__]
# model is a developed version of the
# `Demucs <https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs>`__ model, a
# waveform based model which separates music into its
# respective sources, such as vocals, bass, and drums.
# Hybrid Demucs effectively uses spectrogram to learn
# through the frequency domain and also moves to time convolutions.
#


######################################################################
# 2. Preparation
# --------------
#
# First, we install the necessary dependencies. The first requirement is
# ``torchaudio`` and ``torch``
#

import torch
import torchaudio

print(torch.__version__)
print(torchaudio.__version__)

######################################################################
# In addition to ``torchaudio``, ``mir_eval`` is required to perform
# signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) calculations. To install ``mir_eval``
# please use ``pip3 install mir_eval``.

# 3. Construct the pipeline
# -------------------------
#
# Pre-trained model weights and related pipeline components are bundled as
# :py:func:`torchaudio.pipelines.HDEMUCS_HIGH_MUSDB_PLUS`. This is a
# :py:class:`torchaudio.models.HDemucs` model trained on
# `MUSDB18-HQ <https://zenodo.org/record/3338373>`__ and additional
# internal extra training data.
# This specific model is suited for higher sample rates, around 44.1 kHZ
# and has a nfft value of 4096 with a depth of 6 in the model implementation.

bundle = HDEMUCS_HIGH_MUSDB_PLUS

model = bundle.get_model()

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

model.to(device)

sample_rate = bundle.sample_rate

print(f"Sample rate: {sample_rate}")

######################################################################
# 4. Configure the application function
# -------------------------------------
#
# Because ``HDemucs`` is a large and memory-consuming model it is
# very difficult to have sufficient memory to apply the model to
# an entire song at once. To work around this limitation,
# obtain the separated sources of a full song by
# chunking the song into smaller segments and run through the
# model piece by piece, and then rearrange back together.
#
# When doing this, it is important to ensure some
# overlap between each of the chunks, to accommodate for artifacts at the
# edges. Due to the nature of the model, sometimes the edges have
# inaccurate or undesired sounds included.
#
# We provide a sample implementation of chunking and arrangement below. This
# implementation takes an overlap of 1 second on each side, and then does
# a linear fade in and fade out on each side. Using the faded overlaps, I
# add these segments together, to ensure a constant volume throughout.
# This accommodates for the artifacts by using less of the edges of the
# model outputs.

# separator in different ways.

# that will create the audio, the spectrogram graph, and also calculate
# the SDR score. SDR is the signal-to-distortion
# ratio, essentially a representation to the “quality” of an audio track.
