=================

.. currentmodule:: torchaudio.models

The ``torchaudio.models`` subpackage contains definitions of models for addressing common audio tasks.

.. note::
   For models with pre-trained parameters, please refer to :mod:`torchaudio.pipelines` module.

Model defintions are responsible for constructing computation graphs and executing them.

Some models have complex structure and variations.
For such models, factory functions are provided.
