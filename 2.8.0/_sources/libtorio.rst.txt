.. warning::
    Starting with version 2.8, we are refactoring TorchAudio to transition it
    into a maintenance phase. As a result:

    - ``torio`` is deprecated in 2.8 and will be removed in 2.9.
    - The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video
      are being consolidated into TorchCodec.

    Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information.
