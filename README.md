The aim of torchaudio is to apply [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to
the audio domain. By supporting PyTorch, torchaudio follows the same philosophy
of providing strong GPU acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through
the autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and dimension names).
Therefore, it is primarily a machine learning library and not a general signal
processing library. The benefits of PyTorch can be seen in torchaudio through
having all the computations be through PyTorch operations which makes it easy
to use and feel like a natural extension.

Installation
------------

### Binary Distributions

`torchaudio` has binary distributions for PyPI (`pip`) and Anaconda (`conda`).

Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the details.

**Note** Starting `0.10`, torchaudio has CPU-only and CUDA-enabled binary distributions, each of which requires a matching PyTorch version.

**Note** This software was compiled against an unmodified copy of FFmpeg (licensed under [the LGPLv2.1](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/a5d2008e2a2360d351798e9abe883d603e231442/COPYING.LGPLv2.1)), with the specific rpath removed so as to enable the use of system libraries. The LGPL source can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/releases/tag/n4.1.8).

### From Source

On non-Windows platforms, the build process builds libsox and codecs that torchaudio need to link to. It will fetch and build libmad, lame, flac, vorbis, opus, and libsox before building extension. This process requires `cmake` and `pkg-config`. libsox-based features can be disabled with `BUILD_SOX=0`.
The build process also builds the RNN transducer loss and CTC beam search decoder. These functionalities can be disabled by setting the environment variable `BUILD_RNNT=0` and `BUILD_CTC_DECODER=0`, respectively.

```bash
# Linux
python setup.py install

# OSX
CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py install

# Windows
# We need to use the MSVC x64 toolset for compilation, with Visual Studio's vcvarsall.bat or directly with vcvars64.bat.
# These batch files are under Visual Studio's installation folder, under 'VC\Auxiliary\Build\'.
# More information available at:
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160#use-vcvarsallbat-to-set-a-64-bit-hosted-build-architecture
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64 && set BUILD_SOX=0 && python setup.py install
# or
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" && set BUILD_SOX=0 && python setup.py install
```

This is known to work on linux and unix distributions such as Ubuntu and CentOS 7 and macOS.
If you try this on a new system and find a solution to make it work, feel free to share it by opening an issue.

Quick Usage
-----------

```python
import torchaudio

waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load('foo.wav')  # load tensor from file
torchaudio.save('foo_save.wav', waveform, sample_rate)  # save tensor to file
```

Backend Dispatch
----------------

By default in OSX and Linux, torchaudio uses SoX as a backend to load and save files.
The backend can be changed to [SoundFile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
using the following. See [SoundFile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for installation instructions.

```python
import torchaudio
torchaudio.set_audio_backend("soundfile")  # switch backend

waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load('foo.wav')  # load tensor from file, as usual
torchaudio.save('foo_save.wav', waveform, sample_rate)  # save tensor to file, as usual
```

**Note**
- SoundFile currently does not support mp3.
- "soundfile" backend is not supported by TorchScript.
