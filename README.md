> [!NOTE]
> **We have transitioned TorchAudio into a

>  Our main goals were to reduce redundancies with the rest of the
>  PyTorch ecosystem, make it easier to maintain, and create a version of
>  TorchAudio that is more tightly scoped to its strengths: processing audio

The aim of torchaudio is to apply [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to
the audio domain. By supporting PyTorch, torchaudio follows the same philosophy
of providing strong GPU acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through
the autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and dimension names).
Therefore, it is primarily a machine learning library and not a general signal
processing library. The benefits of PyTorch can be seen in torchaudio through
having all the computations be through PyTorch operations which makes it easy
to use and feel like a natural extension.

Disclaimer on Datasets
----------------------

This is a utility library that downloads and prepares public datasets. We do not host or distribute these datasets, vouch for their quality or fairness, or claim that you have license to use the dataset. It is your responsibility to determine whether you have permission to use the dataset under the dataset's license.

If you're a dataset owner and wish to update any part of it (description, citation, etc.), or do not want your dataset to be included in this library, please get in touch through a GitHub issue. Thanks for your contribution to the ML community!

Pre-trained Model License
-------------------------

The pre-trained models provided in this library may have their own licenses or terms and conditions derived from the dataset used for training. It is your responsibility to determine whether you have permission to use the models for your use case.

For instance, SquimSubjective model is released under the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC 4.0) license. See [the link](https://zenodo.org/record/4660670#.ZBtWPOxuerN) for additional details.

Audio augmentation using sox_effect
-------------------------
Step 1: Install torchaudio            
pip install torchaudio   

Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries
import torchaudio
import torchaudio.sox_effects as sox_effects
      
Step 3: Load an Audio File  
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load("path_to_audio_file")    
 
Step 4: Define the SoX Effects and apply the effects to input audio. In this example, I apply time_stretch, loudness, and high-pass filter adjustment.
   
effects = [
  ["tempo", "1.25"], # Increase the playback speed (tempo) by 25%  
  ["gain", "10"], # Amplify the audio by 10 dB  
  ["highpass", "1000"], # Apply a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz  
]

augmented_waveform, augmented_sample_rate = sox_effects.apply_effects_tensor(
    waveform,     
    sample_rate,  
    effects  
)

Step 5: Save the Augmented Audio

torchaudio.save("augmented_audio.wav", augmented_waveform, augmented_sample_rate)
