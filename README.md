![TorchAudio Logo](docs/source/_static/img/logo.png)

The aim of torchaudio is to apply [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to
the audio domain. By supporting PyTorch, torchaudio follows the same philosophy
of providing strong GPU acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through
the autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and dimension names).
Therefore, it is primarily a machine learning library and not a general signal
processing library. The benefits of PyTorch can be seen in torchaudio through
having all the computations be through PyTorch operations which makes it easy
to use and feel like a natural extension.

- [Support audio I/O (Load files, Save files)](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/)
  - Load a variety of audio formats, such as `wav`, `mp3`, `ogg`, `flac`, `opus`, `sphere`, into a torch Tensor using SoX
  - [Kaldi (ark/scp)](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/kaldi_io.html)
- [Dataloaders for common audio datasets](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/datasets.html)
- Audio and speech processing functions
  - [forced_align](https://pytorch.org/audio/main/generated/torchaudio.functional.forced_align.html)
- Common audio transforms
  - [Spectrogram, AmplitudeToDB, MelScale, MelSpectrogram, MFCC, MuLawEncoding, MuLawDecoding, Resample](http://pytorch.org/audio/main/transforms.html)
- Compliance interfaces: Run code using PyTorch that align with other libraries
  - [Kaldi: spectrogram, fbank, mfcc](https://pytorch.org/audio/main/compliance.kaldi.html)
