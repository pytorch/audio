# https://github.com/bmcfee/resampy/issues/106
# Since 2022-07-07 build_docs CI job started to fail.
# Pinning resampy to 0.2.2 resolves this.
# The real cause is not know at the moment but the use
# of librosa seems to cause this
# https://github.com/bmcfee/resampy/issues/106
# In our case, the tutorial timed out is online_asr_tutorial,
# which itself does not use resampy
# However audio_feature_augmentation_tutorial is executed before that,
# which uses librosa.
resampy==0.2.2
