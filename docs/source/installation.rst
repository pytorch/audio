Installing pre-built binaries
=============================

``torchaudio`` has binary distributions for PyPI (``pip``) and Anaconda (``conda``).

Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the details.

.. note::

   Each ``torchaudio`` package is compiled against specific version of ``torch``.
   Please refer to the following table and install the correct pair of ``torch`` and ``torchaudio``.

.. note::

   Starting ``0.10``, torchaudio has CPU-only and CUDA-enabled binary distributions,
   each of which requires a corresponding PyTorch distribution.

.. note::
   This software was compiled against an unmodified copy of FFmpeg (licensed under `the LGPLv2.1 <https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/a5d2008e2a2360d351798e9abe883d603e231442/COPYING.LGPLv2.1>`_), with the specific rpath removed so as to enable the use of system libraries. The LGPL source can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/releases/tag/n4.1.8>`_.

Dependencies
------------

* `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_

  Please refer to the compatibility matrix bellow for supported PyTorch versions.

Optional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org>`_.

  Required to use :py:mod:`torchaudio.io` module.
  TorchAudio official binary distributions are compatible with FFmpeg 4.1 to 4.4.
  If you need to use FFmpeg 5, please build TorchAudio from source.

* `sentencepiece <https://pypi.org/project/sentencepiece/>`_

  Required for performing automatic speech recognition with :ref:`Emformer RNN-T<RNNT>`.

* `deep-phonemizer <https://pypi.org/project/deep-phonemizer/>`_

  Required for performing text-to-speech with :ref:`Tacotron2`.

* `kaldi_io <https://pypi.org/project/kaldi-io/>`_

  Required to use :py:mod:`torchaudio.kaldi_io` module.

   
Compatibility Matrix
--------------------

The official binary distributions of TorchAudio contain extension modules
which are written in C++ and linked against specific versions of PyTorch.

TorchAudio and PyTorch from different releases cannot be used together.
Please refer to the following table for the matching versions.
