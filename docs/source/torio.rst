``torio`` is an alternative top-level module for I/O features. The is the extraction of the core implementation of I/O feature of ``torchaudio``.

If you want to use the multimedia processing features, but do not want to depend on the entire ``torchaudio`` package, you can use ``torio``.

.. note::

   Currently, ``torio`` is distributed alongside ``torchaudio``, and there is no stand-alone
   procedure to install ``torio`` only. Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
   for the installation of ``torchaudio``.
