The examples in this directory demonstrate applied use of the torchaudio library. They are included only for reference purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> **We have transitioned TorchAudio into a
>  maintenance phase. Our main goals were to reduce redundancies with the rest of the
>  PyTorch ecosystem, make it easier to maintain, and create a version of
>  TorchAudio that is more tightly scoped to its strengths: processing audio
>  data for ML. Because of this transition, the examples included here will no longer be maintained
>  going forward. The scripts may not work properly as is. For hands on examples of features in the
>  library that *are* still supported, see the "tutorials" subdirectory. Please see
>  [our community message](https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902)
>  for more details.**
