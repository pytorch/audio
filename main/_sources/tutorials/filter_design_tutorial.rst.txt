Filter design tutorial
======================

**Author**: `Moto Hira <moto@meta.com>`__

This tutorial shows how to create basic digital filters
(impulse responses) and their properties.

We look into low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters based on
windowed-sinc kernels, and frequency sampling method.

.. warning::
   This tutorial requires prototype DSP features, which are
   available in nightly builds.

   Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally
   for instructions for installing a nightly build.

Windowed-Sinc Filter
--------------------


`Sinc filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter>`_ is an
idealized filter which removes frequencies above the cutoff
frequency without affecting the lower frequencies.

Sinc filter has infinite filter width in analytical solution.
In numerical computation, sinc filter cannot be expressed exactly,
so an approximation is required.

Windowed-sinc finite impulse response is an approximation of sinc
filter. It is obtained by first evaluating sinc function for given
cutoff frequencies, then truncating the filter skirt, and
applying a window, such as Hamming window, to reduce the
artifacts introduced from the truncation.

:py:func:`~torchaudio.prototype.functional.sinc_impulse_response`
generates windowed-sinc impulse response for given cutoff
frequencies.

High-pass filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

High-pass filter can be obtained by subtracting low-pass
impulse response from the Dirac delta function.

Passing ``high_pass=True`` to
:py:func:`~torchaudio.prototype.functional.sinc_impulse_response`
will change the returned filter kernel to high pass filter.

Frequency Sampling
------------------

The next method we look into starts from a desired frequency response
and obtain impulse response by applying inverse Fourier transform.

:py:func:`~torchaudio.prototype.functional.frequency_impulse_response`
takes (unnormalized) magnitude distribution of frequencies and
construct impulse response from it.

Note however that the resulting impulse response does not produce the
desired frequency response.

In the following, we create multiple filters and compare the input
frequency response and the actual frequency response.
