    Note:
        This function can handle all the codecs that underlying libsox can handle,

        * WAV, AMB

            * 32-bit floating-point

        * FLAC
        * OGG/VORBIS
        * OPUS
        * SPHERE
        * AMR-NB

        To load ``MP3``, ``FLAC``, ``OGG/VORBIS``, ``OPUS`` and other codecs ``libsox`` does not
        handle natively, your installation of ``torchaudio`` has to be linked to ``libsox``
        and corresponding codec libraries such as ``libmad`` or ``libmp3lame`` etc.

    By default (``normalize=True``, ``channels_first=True``), this function returns Tensor with
    ``float32`` dtype and the shape of ``[channel, time]``.
    The samples are normalized to fit in the range of ``[-1.0, 1.0]``.

    When the input format is WAV with integer type, such as 32-bit signed integer, 16-bit
    signed integer, 24-bit signed integer, and 8-bit unsigned integer, by providing ``normalize=False``,
    this function can return integer Tensor, where the samples are expressed within the whole range
    of the corresponding dtype, that is, ``int32`` tensor for 32-bit signed PCM,
    ``int16`` for 16-bit signed PCM and ``uint8`` for 8-bit unsigned PCM. Since torch does not
    support ``int24`` dtype, 24-bit signed PCM are converted to ``int32`` tensors.

    ``normalize`` parameter has no effect on 32-bit floating-point WAV and other formats, such as
    ``flac`` and ``mp3``.
    For these formats, this function always returns ``float32`` Tensor with values normalized to
    ``[-1.0, 1.0]``.

            TorchScript compiler compatibility.
        frame_offset (int):
            Number of frames to skip before start reading data.
        num_frames (int):
            Maximum number of frames to read. ``-1`` reads all the remaining samples,
            starting from ``frame_offset``.
            This function may return the less number of frames if there is not enough
            frames in the given file.
        normalize (bool):
            When ``True``, this function always return ``float32``, and sample values are
            normalized to ``[-1.0, 1.0]``.
            If input file is integer WAV, giving ``False`` will change the resulting Tensor type to
            integer type.
            This argument has no effect for formats other than integer WAV type.
        channels_first (bool):
            When True, the returned Tensor has dimension ``[channel, time]``.
            Otherwise, the returned Tensor's dimension is ``[time, channel]``.
        format (str, optional):
            Override the format detection with the given format.
            Providing the argument might help when libsox can not infer the format

    Returns:

            If the input file has integer wav format and normalization is off, then it has
            integer type, else ``float32`` type. If ``channels_first=True``, it has
