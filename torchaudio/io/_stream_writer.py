                otherwise a default one is picked.

                For example, ``"opus"`` encoder only supports 48k Hz, so, when encoding a

                If the original sample rate is one of these, then the original sample rate
                is used, otherwise it will be resampled to a default one (44.1k).
                When encoding into WAV format, there is no restriction on sample rate,
                so the original sample rate will be used.
